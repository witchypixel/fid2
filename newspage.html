<h2> <p> Low and Slow, posted by BGB <time> November 15,2016 </time> </p>
<p> This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>soux vide</dfn></i>. In <i>soux vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food, 
(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
In his book, <em>Cooking for Geeks,<em> Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low temperature poaching.<q></p>
<Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide</p> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, please contact us before November 30th. </p>

<p> Location: Baker's'Corner, Sekonk, MA </p>
<p>Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm. </p>
