<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p> This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>soux vide</dfn></i>. In <i>soux vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food, 
(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.
In his book, <em>Cooking for Geeks,<em> Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low temperature poaching. </p>
<Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide</p> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, please contact us before November 30th. </p>

<p> Warning: <i>Sous vide</i> cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant, or have immunity issues. </p>
